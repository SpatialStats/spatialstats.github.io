### The Space Time Cube Explorer

The Space Time Cube Explorer, developed for ArcGIS Pro, greatly enhances the way you can interact with and explore your space-time cubes created using the [Space Time Pattern Mining toolbox](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/space-time-pattern-mining/an-overview-of-the-space-time-pattern-mining-toolbox.htm).  

The Add-in will take your space-time cube as input and create layers that can be quickly and beautifully displayed from the Display Gallery.  This gallery has a number of useful display options all with preset symbology, range sliders and time sliders providing a seamless experience as you explore the results of your space-time pattern mining analyses.

You can watch a Live Training Seminar that covers the essentials of the Space Time Pattern Mining toolbox and demonstrations using this Add-In [here](https://www.esri.com/training/catalog/57b3c46754c097bb74d3e6c3/space-time-pattern-mining:-a-new-frontier-in-spatial-analysis/).
