Combine the power of ArcGIS and R to solve your spatial problems. The R – ArcGIS Community is a community driven collection of free, open source projects making it easier and faster for R users to work with ArcGIS data, and ArcGIS users to leverage the analysis capabilities of R.

### The R ArcGIS Bridge Github Repository

The [R ArcGIS Bridge Github repository](https://r-arcgis.github.io/) has all the resources you need to find out what the R-ArcGIS Bridge can do, how to install it and sample scripts highlighting some of the many features.

Under the ‘Issues’ section of the r-bridge-install page, users can post direct questions to us or ask for additional functionality they might need. We also have a section where R-ArcGIS bridge community members can share script tools they have created to help other users.

### R ArcGIS Bridge GeoNet Community

We regularly post blogs, demo videos, or content from presentations on the bridge [here](https://community.esri.com/groups/rstats). Additionally, there is a forum where users can ask questions to either other users or to the R-ArcGIS bridge team.


### Installation Instructions
Looking to install the bridge? We have [detailed instructions](https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/r-bridge-install) for ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro.

### Resources to Get Started Using the R-ArcGIS Bridge


#### Using the R-ArcGIS Bridge - Web Course

Combine the power of ArcGIS and R to solve complex spatial problems with the R-ArcGIS bridge. [This course](https://www.esri.com/training/catalog/58b5e417b89b7e000d8bfe45/using-the-r-arcgis-bridge/) shows you how to load spatial data into an R workspace to perform statistical analysis using the R-ArcGIS bridge.

Do you want to try out the R-ArcGIS Bridge? Use [this Learn ArcGIS Lesson](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/analyze-crime-using-statistics-and-the-r-arcgis-bridge/) to analyze crime patterns in San Francisco using hot spot analysis, Empirical Bayes smoothing and correlation matrices.


#### Integrating R Scripts into ArcGIS Geoprocessing Tools

This is a [guided web course](https://www.esri.com/training/catalog/58b5e578b89b7e000d8bfffd/integrating-r-scripts-into-arcgis-geoprocessing-tools/) on creating an R script tool. It walks through the process of creating one on both the ArcGIS and R side. This is a good resources for first time script tool creation.

#### Arcgisbinding Package Vignette

For users more comfortable with R scripting, the [package vignette](https://r-arcgis.github.io/assets/arcgisbinding-vignette.html) is a good resource because it provides a detailed description of each function in the arcgisbinding R package and can just be used as a resource versus a full tutorial like some of the above options. It also includes a template for creating script tools.

#### Sample Script Tools

These [sample script tools](https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/r-sample-tools) can be used as working examples to create new script tools off of.
