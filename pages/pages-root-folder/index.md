## Welcome to the Spatial Statistics Resources Page


Whenever we look at a map, we inherently start turning that map into information by finding patterns, assessing trends, or making decisions. Spatial statistics empowers you to answer questions confidently and make important decisions using more than simple visual analysis. Below are resources that will help you learn more. If you have questions or awesome analysis stories, there is a [Spatial Statistics Forum](https://community.esri.com/community/gis/analysis/spatial-statistics) on GeoNet — We’d love to hear from you!

#### The Space Time Cube Explorer (STCE)
The Space Time Cube Explorer add-in can help you interact with and explore your space-time cube and analysis results created with the [Space Time Pattern Mining toolbox](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/space-time-pattern-mining/an-overview-of-the-space-time-pattern-mining-toolbox.htm) in a simple and intuitive way.  This update includes many new features and enhancements such as the ability to output 3D polygons from a [defined locations cube](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/space-time-pattern-mining/createcubefromdefinedlocations.htm) and enhanced time and range slider settings. You can download the add-in at [www.esriurl.com/SpaceTimeCubeExplorer](http://www.esriurl.com/SpaceTimeCubeExplorer) .

#### The Spatial Statistics Team is Growing
Does spatial analysis exhilarate you?  Do you find solving tough problems thrilling?  If you said yes, we are looking for a few people just like you! Come join our passionate team of hard working and close-knit developers and product engineers working to advance space-time data exploration and analysis techniques.  Check out our job postings [here](http://www.esri.com/careers/main/job-detail?jobID=7220&term=Full%20Time&jobtype=ArcGIS%20Product%20Engineering&location=Redlands,%20CA&capath=&loc=&jsearch=Spatial%20Stat)

#### Coming Soon
Our team is currently developing new clustering tools which will be released in ArcGIS Pro 2.1.
